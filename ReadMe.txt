**The main idea of the program is to let users create account and
sign in back to their account to see their account information. 
(All of their information is stored in a database.)

**It is preferable to run the program on NetBeans IDE because 
it was coded and tested on NetBeans. 

**To run the application on NetBeans, right click on the LoginSystem 
project and select run from the options or you can to the web pages 
directory and run the index file.  

**The application is built with derby database. All data are imported 
to and exported from the derby database.
